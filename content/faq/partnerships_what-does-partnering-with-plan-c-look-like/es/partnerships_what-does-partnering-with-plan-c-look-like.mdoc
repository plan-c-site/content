# SPANISH VERSION
Partnering with us can look many different ways. If you can dream it, we want to help you achieve it! Some of our past work includes joint media campaigns, murals, community resource events, abortion pill webinars, billboards, block parties, tabling, podcasts, and so much more. The goal of Plan C partnerships is to raise awareness about self-managed abortion nationwide, and the creativity of partnerships helps to further that goal.
