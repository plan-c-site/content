question: Iâ€™ve heard about Period Pills. Are they different from abortion pills?
---
Period Pills are just starting to gain popularity in the United States, so you may not have heard of them before now. But in other countries around the world, people use Period Pills when their periods are late and they want it to come back so that they can be sure they are not pregnant. They are the same medicines used for abortion but you do not need to take a pregnancy test or confirm you are pregnant before using period pills. If you are pregnant, they will cause an abortion. Some people just want to get their periods back so that they know they are not pregnant.
