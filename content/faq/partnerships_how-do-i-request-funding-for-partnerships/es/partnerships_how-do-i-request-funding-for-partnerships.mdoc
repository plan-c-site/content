# SPANISH VERSION
Funding for partnerships is available in certain circumstances and is decided on a case-by-case basis. Partners interested in funding will meet with our Partnerships team to discuss the project goals and funding needs. Depending on how the projects align with our strategic objectives, funding will be granted, and a formal partnership agreement will be created. If you are interested in having a project funded, please reach out to our Partnerships Director at {% inlineLink action={discriminant: ""} %}partners@plancpills.org{% /inlineLink %}.
