Websites that sell pills do not offer medical support. {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://www.mahotline.org", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}The Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline{% /inlineLink %} provides free, confidential medical information and support by phone and text. Often they can help people address a problem without needing to go to a clinic or hospital.

Anyone who is experiencing complications and feels the need to seek care from a health care provider at a clinic or hospital should do so. The clinician does not need to know that someone had used abortion pills to provide appropriate follow up care. Clinicians also can’t tell someone has taken abortion pills unless they tell them, or if they inserted the misoprostol vaginally and the pills did not fully dissolve. Many people use misoprostol orally to prevent this possible detection.

Some people who have told their clinician that they used abortion pills have faced legal prosecution. This is why many people just say they are having a miscarriage. The symptoms after taking abortion pills are the same as a miscarriage, and {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://gynuity.org/resources/info/faq-on-misoprostol-detection-in-blood", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}blood tests do not reveal any differences between a miscarriage and a medication abortion{% /inlineLink %}.

Free, nonjudgmental emotional support before, during, and after abortion is available from the folks at {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}All-Options Talkline{% /inlineLink %}, {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://exhaleprovoice.org", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}Exhale{% /inlineLink %}, {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://www.faithaloud.org", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}Faith Aloud{% /inlineLink %}, or {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://reprocare.com", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}Reprocare{% /inlineLink %}.
