question: How many pills do I need?
---
**We link to online websites that provide at least 1 mifepristone and 8 misoprostol tablets (some provide up to 14 misoprostol tablets). It may not be necessary to use all of these tablets, but doctors recommend having extra pills on hand in case you need them.**

If you are *under* 9 weeks pregnant the starting dose is 1 mifepristone pill and 4 misoprostol pills. But, you may need extra misoprostol to complete the abortion. **People who are more than 9 weeks pregnant often need additional misoprostol pills (8 or 12+ miso pills total) to complete the abortion.**
