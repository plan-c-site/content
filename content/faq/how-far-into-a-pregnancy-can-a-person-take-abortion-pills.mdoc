[Abortion pills are usually taken in the first 13-14 weeks of pregnancy](https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/medical-abortion/). Many providers stick to a 12-week guideline, which is what the [World Health Organization recommends](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-SRH-22.1).

We know people [safely take abortion pills later in pregnancy](https://www.ineedana.com/pills-after-12-weeks). For questions about abortion after 13 or 14 weeks, contact the [M+A Hotline](https://mahotline.org) or [Reprocare](https://reprocare.com). [Community support networks](https://redstateaccess.org) can also help with information and support for taking pills after 13 weeks. Someone can also have an abortion procedure at a [clinic](https://ineedana.com) after 13 weeks, and some [groups](https://accessrj.org/get-support) can help with funding.

Here is some important information for people taking abortion pills after 12 weeks:

- [This article from Ineedana describes how people take abortion pills after 12 weeks](https://www.ineedana.com/pills-after-12-weeks), which is different from how they take them before 12 weeks.
- Taking pills later in pregnancy can be more painful and might not work as well.
- The risk of complications goes up as the pregnancy continues.
- Legal risks can also be higher with later abortions. The [Repro Legal Helpline ](https://reprolegalhelpline.org)can answer specific legal questions.

A {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "pregnancy"} _language="" %}pregnancy calculator{% /inlineLink %} can help someone determine how many weeks pregnant they are, based on the first day of their last regular period. If they don’t know that date or if their periods are irregular, they might need an ultrasound or pelvic exam to find out how far along they are.
