question: Where someone lives makes a difference

Pills are available by mail in all states, even in states that ban clinic-based abortion care. Using pills by mail is medically safe.

If you live in a state that has restrictions on abortion (like a total ban or gestation restrictions), using pills by mail may come with some legal risk. We mark services with an info icon (i) in our&nbsp;Guide&nbsp;to let you know that they may have legal risk.

To understand the potential legal risks, you can contact the ReproLegal Helpline, a free legal resource that can help answer your questions: visit&nbsp;reprolegalhelpline.org&nbsp;or call or text 844-868-2812.
