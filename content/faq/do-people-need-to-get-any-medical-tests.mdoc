Most people start by taking a pregnancy test to confirm their pregnancy before using abortion pills, but this is not required. Generally, no additional medical tests are needed to get abortion pills. However, a clinic or telehealth service may request further tests if:

- You are not sure when your last period was.
- You have a history or symptoms of ectopic pregnancy, such as severe pelvic pain.

Some people prefer not to confirm that they are pregnant before using the pills. Sometimes this is referred to as using menstrual regulation, period pills or missed period pills. {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "internal", value: {page: "missed-period-pills"}} _language="" %}Learn more about missed period pills here{% /inlineLink %}.
