question: Do people need to get any medical tests?
---
Most people start by taking a pregnancy test to confirm their pregnancy, but this is not required. Generally, no additional medical tests are needed to get abortion pills. However, a clinic or telehealth service may request further tests if:

- You are not sure when your last period was.
- You have a history or symptoms of ectopic pregnancy, such as severe pelvic pain.
