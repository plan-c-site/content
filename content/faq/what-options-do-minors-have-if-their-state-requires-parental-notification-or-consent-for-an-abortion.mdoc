[Some states ](https://reprolegalhelpline.org/abortion-laws-by-state/)require that parents be notified or give consent for a minor to get an abortion. Abortion providers can help people understand the law in their state and how parental notification or consent works.

Minors who do not feel comfortable or safe involving a parent or guardian in the decision to have an abortion have two options:

1. Request service from a provider (like [Aid Access](https://aidaccess.org/en/)) who offers telehealth from a state with protective “[shield laws](https://msmagazine.com/2023/07/24/usa-mail-abortion-pills/).” They can help minors without needing parental consent or notification.
1. Obtain a judicial bypass, which is permission from a judge. This process is free but can be complicated and may take 1-3 weeks. [It involves going to court to fill out forms and meeting with a judge](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-get-an-abortion-if-youre-a-teen). Organizations like [If/When/How](https://ifwhenhow.org/), the [ACLU](https://aclu.org/), and [Jane’s Due Process](https://janesdueprocess.org/) can assist.
