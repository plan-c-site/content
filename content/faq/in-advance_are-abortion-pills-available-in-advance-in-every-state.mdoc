question: Are abortion pills available in advance in every state?
---
Yes, abortion pills can be ordered in advance from any state. Use the information above or refer to [this state directory](https://www.plancpills.org/in-advance#state-search) to find a provider.&nbsp;

Since the end of *Roe v. Wade*, tens of thousands of people across the US have ordered pills in advance, and [those numbers continue to rise](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/10/abortion-medication-orders-pre-pregnancy-research.html).

Getting pills in certain states or under specific circumstances may involve legal risks. The [Repro Legal Helpline](https://www.reprolegalhelpline.org/) can answer specific questions.
