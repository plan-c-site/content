question: "What if I need medical support after taking period pills?\_"

Period pill providers tell their patients how to contact them for follow-up support or if they have questions while taking the pills. The M+A Hotline and Reprocare are two free support hotlines that also can answer peopleâ€™s questions about taking period pills.
