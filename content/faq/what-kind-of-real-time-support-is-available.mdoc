There are many free services that support people during their abortions.&nbsp;

- [The Miscarriage and Abortion (M+A) Hotline](https://www.mahotline.org/) gives free, confidential medical information and support via phone and text.&nbsp;
- The [Reprocare Healthline](https://abortionhotline.org/) offers emotional support and information about what to expect during a home abortion, also by phone or text.&nbsp;
- Additionally, there are chatbots and apps, like [Euki](https://eukiapp.org/) and the [Aya Contigo](https://hola.ayacontigo.org/en), that can guide someone through the process.
