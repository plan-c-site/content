question: Why havenâ€™t I heard of period pills before?
---
The concept of period pills is just starting to gain popularity in the United States. But in other countries around the world, these pills are used when periods are late and folks want to get their period and not be pregnant.&nbsp; For example, in Bangladesh, the government promotes menstrual regulation, and women may take period pills up to ten weeks after missing their periods, to ensure they are not pregnant. Using herbs or teas to bring down a period is also a part of our tradition in the US. The difference now is that we have very safe and effective medications we can take to do the same thing.
