We link to sites that sell mifepristone plus misoprostol, the two kinds of pills used for abortion. These are usually packaged in a foil blister pack that contains 5 pills: 1 dose of mifepristone (1 pill) and 1 dose of misoprostol (4 pills). Doctors&nbsp;recommend that people get extra misoprostol to have on hand in case an extra dose is needed to complete the abortion. The sites we list provide at least one mifepristone and at least 8 misoprostol. Read the next section “How many pills do people need?” for more information.
