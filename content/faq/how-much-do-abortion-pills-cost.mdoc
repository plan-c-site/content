Abortion pills can cost anywhere from $40 to $600 or more, depending on where someone gets them.

- Ordering online by using telehealth usually costs $150 or less.
- Getting them at a clinic averages around $600.

Many places accept insurance or Medicaid, and some offer discounts (even free) for people who can’t pay: just ask.
