question: How do I choose a provider?
---
People usually choose an online clinic based on what kind of telehealth care they are comfortable with. &nbsp;Some providers require a phone or video visit while other providers communicate with you through text or email.

Cost and ship times are also a factor. &nbsp;Sometimes a range of prices will be shown when a provider accepts insurance or offers discounted pricing or another form of financial assistance.
