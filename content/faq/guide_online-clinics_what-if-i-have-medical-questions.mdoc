Online clinics usually offer medical support during and after the abortion. The format of this care depends on the provider. Some providers use phone or video visits (we call this a “Virtual visit with provider”) while others communicate through text or email (we call this “Online consultation by form”).

They can also help people {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://still-open-clinics.webflow.io", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}find a nearby clinic that provides post-abortion care.{% /inlineLink %}

Important: For people who live in an abortion restrictive state and travel to another state to receive telehealth or in-person care, sometimes providers will not be able to provide follow up care if the patient tells them they have returned to the restrictive state.
