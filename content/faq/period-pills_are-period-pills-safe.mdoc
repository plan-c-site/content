Yes. These pills have been used for decades and are {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://www.reproductiveaccess.org/resource/insights-period-pills", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}safe{% /inlineLink %}. They cause bleeding and cramping, but these are expected effects of the medications and indicate that they are working.
