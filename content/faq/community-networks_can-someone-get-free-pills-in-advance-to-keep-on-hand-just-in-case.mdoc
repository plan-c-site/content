question: Can someone get free pills in advance (to keep on hand just in case)?

No. Community networks only serve people who are already pregnant. To learn about services that offer pills in advance, visit {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "internal", value: {page: "in-advance"}} _language="" %}plancpills.org/in-advance{% /inlineLink %}.
