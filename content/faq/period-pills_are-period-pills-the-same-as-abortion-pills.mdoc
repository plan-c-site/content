question: Are period pills the same as abortion pills?
---
The medications used as period pills are the same pills used for abortion (mifepristone and misoprostol). But they are taken before pregnancy is confirmed. If someone is already pregnant when they take period pills, the pills will cause an abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;
