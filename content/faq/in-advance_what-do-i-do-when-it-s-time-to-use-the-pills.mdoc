question: What do I do when it's time to use the pills?
---
When ordered from a medical provider or service, people often contact the original provider if they decide to use the pills. People can also use directions and resources found online to self-manage their abortion with pills. The free confidential [Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline](https://mahotline.org/) can also answer questions.

See Plan C's [step-by-step instructions for using abortion pills](https://www.plancpills.org/protocol), developed with the M+A Hotline.
