question: What are websites that sell pills?
---
Websites that sell pills are e-commerce websites that sell and ship pills to addresses in all U.S. states. They do not require a prescription for the medications, do not require the purchaser to upload an ID, and do not provide a medical consultation or any kind of support. The pills usually arrive by the US Postal Service. They usually do not require a signature.
