- Research shows that hundreds of thousands of people have received and used pills by mail over the past few years with no legal problems.&nbsp;
- But, in rare cases (less than 1%), people have gotten in legal trouble, even though most states don’t have laws against doing your own abortion.
- Legal risk can depend on where someone lives, their identity and how far along they are in pregnancy. Also know that even if something isn’t a crime, people can still be targeted by law enforcement.&nbsp;
