Telehealth services and community networks provide information about how people can contact them if they have a question.

[The Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline](https://www.mahotline.org) also provides free, confidential medical information and support by phone and text. Often they can help people address a problem without needing to go to a clinic or hospital or make a referral to a [clinic near you that provides post-abortion care](https://still-open-clinics.webflow.io).

Anyone who is experiencing complications and feels the need to seek care from a health care provider at a clinic or hospital should do so. The clinician does not need to know that someone has used abortion pills to provide appropriate follow up care. Clinicians also can’t tell if someone has taken abortion pills unless they tell them, or if the person inserted the misoprostol vaginally and the pills did not fully dissolve. Many people use misoprostol orally to prevent this possible detection.

Some people who have told their clinician that they used abortion pills have faced legal prosecution. This is why many people just say they are having a miscarriage. The symptoms after taking abortion pills are the same as a miscarriage, and [blood tests do not reveal any differences between a miscarriage and a medication abortion](https://gynuity.org/resources/info/faq-on-misoprostol-detection-in-blood).

These groups offer free, nonjudgmental emotional support before, during, and after abortion: [All-Options Talkline](https://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline), [Exhale](https://exhaleprovoice.org), [Faith Aloud](https://www.faithaloud.org), or [Reprocare](https://reprocare.com).
