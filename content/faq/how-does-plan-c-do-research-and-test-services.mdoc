question: 'How does Plan C do research and test services?  '
---
Our research goal is to understand what services are available and document how the services work. Plan C works with volunteer “mystery shoppers” to buy abortion pills from online vendors, assess how the process goes, and what comes in the mail. The mystery shoppers share details such as:

- Cost information: price, shipping costs, and any hidden fees
- Shipping and delivery information: ship times, comparing advertised ship time versus how long it actually takes, how the product is packaged, whether signature was required on delivery, condition of packaging, and return address
- Payment information: payment methods accepted, how the services process payments
- Product information: how the pills are packaged, product name, expiration date, and contact information provided by the service or provider.

After the packages arrive, volunteer shoppers send the pills to Plan C, where our team visually inspects the products and packaging. Volunteers also share notes about their experience, including customer service and any delivery problems.

In addition to mystery shopping, Plan C periodically conducts laboratory tests of abortion pills to check to see if they contain the correct active ingredients and meet basic medication quality specifications. Plan C has done that by testing pills received through mystery shopping and sampling abortion pills made in India that match the brands found through the mystery shopping research. The second testing method lets us test larger batches in a lab, which has minimum medication volume requirements, to make sure the pills meet quality standards.

Plan C uses an International Organization for Standardization or ISO-certified lab to run these tests, which included identification and assay of labeled active ingredients, disintegration, uniformity of content, friability, dissolution, and impurities.
