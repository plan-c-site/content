## Autumn Breon&nbsp;

In December 2024, Plan C showed up big during Art Week Miami.We continued our collaboration with artist Autumn Breon, who showcased her CareMachine at the Prizm Art Fair. The Care Machine is a retrofitted vending machine thatprovides free care products ( such as pads, tampons, and pregnancy tests) andinformation about abortion pills access, and specifically Plan C! Autumn talked aboutthis project and her work with Plan C at Untitled Art Fair during a panel discussion aboutart and civic engagement hosted by Plan C and For Freedoms, as well as during @Feministpanel discussion and salon event on art and activism at Moxy South Beach.

## Milagros

Our biggest activation during Art Week Miami was a Plan C mural designed and installed by the art collective, Milagros and Nina Yagual, in collaboration with their Louisiana contemporary art gallery, Ten Nineteen. This mural was installed outside of the popular event space , Gramps, centrally located in Wynwood, Miamiâ€™s Art District. On opening night, we partnered with Gramps to host a mural launch party/drag night where we got to pass out Plan C materials to attendees, take pictures of people with the mural, and engage with guests about Plan C in a casual setting.
