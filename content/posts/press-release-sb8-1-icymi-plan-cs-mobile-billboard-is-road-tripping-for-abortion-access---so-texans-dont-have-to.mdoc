_No abortion ban will stop the need for abortion care in Texas._

**TEXAS** – Plan C is finishing up a ”road trip to end all road trips” for abortion access, traveling through Lubbock and West Texas with a mobile billboard truck in response to Texas’s six-week abortion ban (SB 8), which is set to go into effect on Wednesday.

*   They visited colleges and universities like West Texas A&M and Texas Tech, talking to students and handing out flyers. They were met with **interest and gratitude** for the information they provided, often educating an individual for the first time about online access to abortion pills and especially under the weight of SB8's looming start date.
*   But on Saturday while making noise in person in Texas, **the Plan C Instagram account was suspended.** They had been sharing activist art and hosting lively dialogue in the comments. But unlike other accounts who do this all day long, the wave of activity resulted in the account being silenced**.** They are now waiting for an internal review of the account.
*   Instead of being discouraged, they took this as a reminder that equitable abortion access cannot be accomplished alone: and watched as their supporters flocked to other platforms like TikTok and Twitter to raise their voices and amplify information and art.
*   On Sunday they learned that an SB8 court case, scheduled for Monday (today) to contest the law and possibly end in an injunction or blocking of the law, was cancelled. No reason was given. And so, they persist.
*   Now more than ever, it’s crucial Texans know that abortion pills are safe, effective, and accessible online for self-managed care.
*   The mobile billboard was on the road in West Texas for three days total. **We’ve compiled images and videos of the mobile billboard here for press use.**

“Times have changed, and the ‘abortion road trip’ is no longer needed,” said **Francine Coeytaux, codirector at Plan C (plancpills.org).** “While many Texans will be able to travel to neighboring states to find care, we also know that many more may not be able to. We want everyone to understand they can take advantage of internet technology and the post office to access and complete an early abortion entirely from home. As Texas increases restrictions on abortion care, we’re here to let folks know that abortion pills by mail are a safe and effective alternative.”

Aside from banning abortion after six weeks (before many people even know they are pregant), Senate Bill 8 is designed to drive fear and confusion by allowing citizen “bounty hunters” to bring civil suits of $10,000 or more against anyone helping someone to access abortion care outside of the restrictive timeline designated by anti-abortion extremists.

“When Texans decide to have an abortion, they should be able to do so safely and with dignity - and without fear of legal consequences,” **said Diana Gómez, advocacy manager at Progress Texas.** “The choice to have an abortion is a health care decision and should be treated as such. Regardless of these draconian anti-abortion laws being passed by extremists in our state, there are alternatives available to give Texans autonomy over our own bodies. Our state and the failed

Republican lawmakers running it should get out of the way and give Texans the freedom to make decisions about our health care needs.”
