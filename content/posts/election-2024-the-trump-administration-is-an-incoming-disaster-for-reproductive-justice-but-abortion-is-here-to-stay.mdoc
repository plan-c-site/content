*November 6, 2024*

Donald Trump’s second administration is an incoming disaster for reproductive justice. While we can expect the worst for abortion rights, we also know that **no matter what, abortion is here to stay**. In all 50 states, even those with bans, abortion access will not be fully dictated by politics or policy, and cannot be stopped. Since the fall of *Roe*, a robust network has formed to help abortion seekers get the care they need in every state. Activist and international providers, community groups, and online vendors will continue to provide abortion seekers with abortion pills and information about how to use them safely, no matter what may come at a federal level.

It’s small comfort, but we’re heartened to see how many of the state abortion referendums passed with large margins: state bans were overturned by ballot measure in MO and AZ, although not FL, SD, or NE; abortion rights were confirmed to the state constitutions in NY, MA, MT, NV, and CO. American voters have affirmed their support for reproductive freedom, repeatedly, when given the choice at the ballot box.

Despite Donald Trump’s double-talk on this issue during the campaign, we fully expect the Trump Administration to push for a national abortion ban and support the many unjust state bans and restrictions that criminalize abortion seekers, providers, advocates, and community members who help with access. We expect to see the tenets of Project 2025 considered or implemented during a Trump administration, including the misapplication of the Comstock Act to prohibit mailing of abortion pills, threats to shield laws, and other attempts to keep life-saving, safe medication out of the hands of people who need it.

As we prepare for this incoming administration and the attack against abortion access, the most important tool we have at this time is information: letting people know that safe abortion access exists, and how to find it. The road ahead is uncertain but in the weeks before Inauguration Day, **there are specific actions people can take now to protect their access and share information**:

‍

1. **Order Plan C stickers.** To date, supporters across the US have ordered more than two million free stickers to put up in their hometowns and on their travels. Stickers link to the Plan C Guide and passively spread information about how people are accessing abortion pills and support, from any state.

{% inlineLink action={discriminant: "internal", value: {page: "stickers"}} _language="" %}plancpills.org/stickers{% /inlineLink %}

‍

2. **Get pills in advance.** The Guide also lists ways people are accessing highly affordable abortion pills now before they need them (as low as $25), to keep on hand just in case.

Visit {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "internal", value: {page: "in-advance"}} _language="" %}plancpills.org/pills-in-advance{% /inlineLink %} to learn more and find pill options.

*And if you want to support people to access pills,* {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://abortionfreedomfund.org/donate", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}*donate*{% /inlineLink %} *to Abortion Freedom Fund.*

‍

3. **Spread the word about resources.** It’s a new era, and it’s important for everyone to know about the new systems beyond traditional clinic care that have evolved in the years post-*Roe*. Learn about and bookmark the resources that exist and will continue to help people access abortion from all states:
   - For pills and info on using them, visit plancpills.org
   - For clinics, travel and pills by mail visit ineedana.com
   - For medical support mahotline.org
   - For legal support reprolegalhelpline.org

New resource {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://youalwayshaveoptions.com", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}**YouAlwaysHaveOptions.com**{% /inlineLink %} was created by SYA, Plan C and other movement partners seeking one simple way to direct people to core resources related to pills, clinics, funding, and medical and legal support. People can save the link, and share widely in response to ongoing news about bans and restrictions.

Plan C remains committed to sharing information about how to access pills in all states through our {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "external", value: {url: "https://www.plancpills.org", showPopup: false}} _language="" %}*Guide to Pills*{% /inlineLink %} as laws and availability evolve so people have the information necessary to access safe options in the face of unjust bans.

*“I’m horrified to be looking at yet another Trump administration, and expect that this iteration will be much worse for abortion seekers than his first. But abortion pills are here to stay. Community distribution networks and overseas providers will remain intact, and abortion pills will continue to come into the country. Through it all, PlanCPills.org will provide information about how to access these safe and effective pills in every state.”*

- *Elisa Wells, Cofounder, Plan C Pills*

**About Plan C:**

‍

Plan C is an information campaign and catalyst for access to abortion pills by mail in the US.

‍

Since 2015, Plan C has helped to lead the way in normalizing self-directed abortion care in the US: actively increasing awareness of this safe and effective method and catalyzing new routes of direct access to pills by mail and with free and confidential support, from any state. Plan C maintains the only comprehensive, research-based {% inlineLink action={discriminant: "home", value: {}} _language="" %}*Guide to Pills*{% /inlineLink %}, which includes both mainstream and alternate routes of access to pills by mail and support in the US. Plan C also runs creative campaigns, works with brands and media, and builds cross-sector partnerships to educate and advocate, make the method more known and available and reach audiences facing the biggest barriers to care. We do this under a vision of disentangling this safe and effective medication from politics, and moving agency over abortion back to the individual seeker.
