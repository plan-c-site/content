[Midwest Access Coalition](https://www.midwestaccesscoalition.org): MAC envisions a world in which all people have access to safe, free, legal abortions wherever they live. As a practical abortion fund, MAC helps people traveling to, from, and within the Midwest access a safe abortion by assisting with travel coordination and costs, lodging, food, medicine, and childcare

**_A note on gendered language:_** _The Plan C team knows that abortion is not just a women’s issue and that trans and non-binary folks also have and need access to abortions. We always try our best to use inclusive language, but some of the research studies and links included in this page do use gendered language._

Abortion pills, often called ‘medication abortion’ or ‘the abortion pill,’ are a safe and effective way to end a pregnancy. [More than half](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions) of all abortions in the US are now done with pills. There are two ways (aka protocols or methods) to have an abortion with pills. One is through a combination of two medicines: Mifepristone and Misoprostol, (often called ‘Mife’ and ‘Miso’). The other is using [only Misoprostol](https://societyfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SFP_ScienceSays_misoprostol.pdf). These videos explain [how to take](https://youtu.be/pB3JsJiz82E) Misoprostol and [what to expect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyZgY7zbCBM) when having an abortion with pills.

Conservatives and the anti-abortion movement are politically motivated to [restrict access to Mifepristone](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4J5BB9H2Bl4vu1n-qf0D4vuHtOcEV2yLYv2B-x0tqs/edit), and in the future Misoprostol-alone may be the only option US clinicians can offer, but you may still be able to get both mifepristone and misoprostol online from places like Aid Access, websites that sell pills, or from trusted advocates in your community.

See [our guide](https://www.plancpills.org/find-pills) for how to access abortion pills by mail in your state. And stay safe, warm and well this holiday season!
