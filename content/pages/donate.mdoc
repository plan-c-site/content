## Where do donations go?

All donations directly support our communications campaigns, partnerships and research aimed at normalizing self-directed care and changing the landscape of abortion access in the U.S.\
\
This includes maintaining our robust platform of resources, amplifying our strategic communications campaigns nationwide, supporting partners and creators, and always centering the person who is seeking an abortion.\
\
Over the past decade, we have reached tens of millions of people with information on self-directed abortion options, as well as catalyzing and funding new telehealth services as they come online, supporting new research initiatives on the method and its outcomes, partnering on national and local creative campaigns, and bolstering an ecosystem of resources for the abortion seeker via hotlines, funds and assistance programs.

All of our work fits into two main goals:&nbsp;that People Know (about pills)&nbsp;and that People Have Access (to pills). View our 2024 Annual Report here.
