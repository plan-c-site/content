Plan C is a public health creative campaign, started in 2015 by a small team of veteran public health advocates, researchers, social justice activists and digital strategists.

Our team holds an array of identities. Some have children, others are childless by choice. Some have had abortions and others have not. This diversity of experiences informs what and how we do our work.

- **Conducting research** and publicly sharing information about how people are accessing abortion pills in the US, including domestic and global evidence about safety and efficacy of medication abortion;
- **Building collaborative relationships** with providers, reproductive health and justice organizations, and technology innovators who share our vision of demedicalizing pills by mail;
- **Calling for universal access to abortion pills**, de-stigmatizing and normalizing the modern option of self-managing an abortion at home, and
- **Centering the transformative nature of abortion pills** and building on decades of their safe self-use, to move agency over abortion back to the individuals who seek them.
