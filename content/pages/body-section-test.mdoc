# How does the abortion pill work?

The abortion pill works by using mifepristone and misoprostol to safely end a pregnancy. The earlier these pills are taken, the better they work.

Abortion pills are a safe and effective way to terminate a pregnancy. It involves taking two medications: mifepristone and misoprostol. The earlier you take them in the pregnancy, the better they work.&nbsp;

The first pill that is taken is mifepristone, which blocks progesterone. Progesterone is a natural hormone in your body that is necessary for supporting a pregnancy, and without it the development of the embryo stops and the lining of your uterus thins, which prevents the embryo from remaining implanted. This medication should not cause side effects.

The second medication, misoprostol, is taken 24 to 48 after taking mifepristone. Misoprostol causes the muscles in your uterus to contract the same way they do during your period, a miscarriage, or childbirth. These contractions cause the uterus to expel the pregnancy, which can include the pregnancy tissue.

{% inContentIcon icon="arrowUp" size="standard" background="beige" color="black" /%}  What are side effects of abortion pills?

Heavy bleeding, cramping, and the passing of clots usually starts within a few hours of taking misoprostol, but it may take up to 24 hours for misoprostol to take effect. The clots can be small or large depending on how far along the pregnancy is.

Cramping and pain are expected during any abortion with pills, but the level of pain is different for everyone. The pain and cramping can range from feeling like a mild to strong period to being more painful than a period.&nbsp;

Some other common symptoms during an abortion with pills are nausea, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea. These symptoms may last several hours to several days. The bleeding will gradually decrease to spotting, which can last a few weeks.

### How do I know if the abortion pills worked?

Most people know that they are no longer pregnant because their pregnancy symptoms go away. &nbsp;If you want to confirm that you are no longer pregnant you can take a pregnancy test 3-4 weeks after taking the abortion medications to ensure that they worked.

(Read From Secret to Shelf, 1999)."}, {title: "2013", text: "In 2013, Coeytaux, then at Public Health Institute, coordinated a meeting with National Women’s Health Network and Ipas to bring together reproductive justice organizations to discuss how to move the issue of self-managed care forward. A key revelation was that misoprostol was available online in the United States, which Wells and others outlined in an unpublished paper called Surfing for Abortion."}, {title: "2015", text: "In 2015, Wells and Coeytaux prepared an analysis for the Reproductive Health Technologies Project about how the lessons learned from emergency contraception could be used to spread awareness of abortion pills as a self-managed method in the United States. During these years, Coeytaux and Wells were also working internationally and witnessing the expansion of access to abortion pills through pharmacies in many countries, and the positive impact that access was having on reducing maternal mortality."}, {title: "2016", text: "In the summer of 2016, we launched the Plan C website to share information about online abortion pills and self-managed abortion.\nIn late 2016, we noticed online vendors selling “abortion kits.” We researched and tested these vendors and published this research in the journal Contraception, as well as on our website as the Plan C Report Card, documenting what we knew to be reliable online sources of pills.\nOver the next three years, our website grew and the Plan C data and team were featured in major publications worldwide."}, {title: "2018", text: "In 2018 we collaborated with UCSF on a study to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of online access to abortion pills throughout California. But the FDA refused to approve the study, for the same reason the restrictions remain in place—politics.  Instead, we took our idea to the state of Washington, where a respected clinic ran with it instead.\nBy now, dozens of online vendors were selling abortion pills, most from within the United States. This was unprecedented. But still there were so many people reaching out to reproductive health organizations, asking for help in self-managing their abortion--and no US organization was able to step up. So AidAccess.org came online to serve the US from the Netherlands, initially helping around 1,000 people/month with medically-supported at-home abortion care. By operating from outside the US, they were able to sidestep the politics of abortion for the time being."}] /%}
