Use the list in Step 5 to find how many misoprostol pills to take and when to take them.

There are three ways to take misoprostol pills. You can put pills inside your cheeks, under your tongue, or in your vagina. Choose the method that feels best to you. Do this between 24-48 hours after swallowing mifepristone.

- **For Mouth:**&nbsp;Put pills inside each cheek or under your tongue. Hold them there for 30 minutes while your body absorbs the medicine. It's ok to swallow your saliva. Then swallow the pills with a drink.
- **For Vagina:**&nbsp;Put pills in your vagina. Lie down for 30 minutes as your body absorbs the medicine. If the pills fall out after 30 minutes, throw them away or flush them.

People concerned with keeping their healthcare private usually put the misoprostol pills inside their cheeks or under the tongue. When misoprostol is inserted into the vagina, there is a chance undissolved pills could be detected during a medical exam.

Cramps and heavy bleeding should start within 24 hours after misoprostol.&nbsp;

- If you have no cramps and bleeding after 4-6 hours, you can use 2 more misoprostol pills.&nbsp;
- You may see blood clots.&nbsp;
- You may have diarrhea, fever, or chills.
- If you use misoprostol in the mouth, it can make your tongue sore. Misoprostol can also cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, shaking - that is normal and should get better within 24 hours.
- If you have nausea you can use anti-nausea medication (benadryl, dramamine or zofran are examples).

The heavy bleeding should slow down within 24 hours. You might bleed on-and-off for a few weeks after the abortion.&nbsp;

Contact your provider if:&nbsp;

- you don't bleed after using misoprostol&nbsp;
- you still have heavy bleeding a few days after the abortion&nbsp;
- you still feel pregnant

Your pregnancy symptoms should go away after you use the pills. Pregnancy tests can stay positive 5 weeks after the abortion. If you're not sure if the abortion worked, you can get an ultrasound. You can have sex again when you feel ready.

You can get pregnant again as soon as 8 days after an abortion. Most birth control methods can be started right after an abortion.

**Important:**&nbsp;If you had an abortion after 12 weeks and your blood type is rH negative (A-, B-, O-, AB-), you should get a shot called Rhogam. This prevents problems in future pregnancies. You should get the shot within 2 days of the abortion.
