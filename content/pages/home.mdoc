## Plan C is an information resource.

We do not give medical or legal advice or sell abortion pills. &nbsp;This website is an educational resource for learning about how people in the US are accessing abortion pills and safely managing their own abortions. Plan C provides research-based information but does not endorse any of the services listed on our website. Plan C is not affiliated with any of the services listed in our directory. For questions about paying for, delivery of, or how to order abortion pills from these services, please contact the service directly.‍

‍A note on language:&nbsp;Abortion pills can be used by people who have a uterus and can get pregnant. This includes cisgender women and people who identify as trans, non-binary, gender-expansive, intersex, Two-Spirit, and more. By using a variety of terms on this website—including “women” and “people who are pregnant”—we aim to be inclusive of all pregnant people who need these services.
