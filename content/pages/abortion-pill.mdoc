### **9. Websites Where People Buy Abortion Pills**

[Websites that sell abortion pills online](https://www.plancpills.org/websites-that-sell-pills)&nbsp;are e-commerce websites that sell and ship pills to addresses in all U.S. states. They do not require a prescription for the medications, do not require the purchaser to upload an ID, and do not provide a medical consultation or any kind of support. The pills usually arrive by the US Postal Service. They usually do not require a signature.

- **Are these websites legit?**&nbsp;Yes, these websites are legit, but they are not like ordering from Amazon. They sell generic abortion pills that are not regulated or inspected by the US government. Plan C tests these websites by buying pills from them. The services we list in our guide all shipped pills to a home address. The pills were real (based on laboratory testing). But, we do not operate these sites, and cannot guarantee they will be reliable in the future.
- **Important**: These websites may not follow strict digital security protocols. Read our&nbsp;[digital privacy tips](https://www.ineedaplanc.org/digital-security)&nbsp;to learn how to protect yourself when ordering or searching for abortion pills online.

Aid Access is a social justice initiative dedicated to ensuring that all people in the United States and its territories who need access to a safe abortion with pills can get it, regardless of their ability to pay. Those who are able to pay and donors who support this effort ensure that everyone can get help in the spirit of mutual support in the face of an unjust system.</td>\n      <td>US-based online clinics</td>\n      <td>Online clinics are US-licensed clinicians who ship pills to you after a brief online form or phone/video visit.
