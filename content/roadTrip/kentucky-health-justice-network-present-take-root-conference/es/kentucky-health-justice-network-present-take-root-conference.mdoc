Take Root is KHJN’s annual conference focusing on education and outreach in “red" states​(or states with majority conservative legislative power) to engage with ally organizations and academic partners.Themes center around gender justice (and, more specifically, the links between escalating attacks on abortion and gender-affirming care), practical support, and advocating for youth.
