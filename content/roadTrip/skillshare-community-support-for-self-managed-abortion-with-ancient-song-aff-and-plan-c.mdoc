Join Ancient Song, Plan C, and AFF on Friday, June 20 at 5:30pm ET for Part 2 of our Self-Managed Abortion Townhall and Skillshare. Gather virtually in a cozy, supportive circle to discuss the physical and medical aspects of self-managed abortion, how to care for ourselves and each other, and where to find help.
